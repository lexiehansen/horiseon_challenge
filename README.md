# horiseon_challenge
Refactoring the existing code to meet accessibility standards. 

My changes include adding semantic HTML elements, adding alt attributes to each image, and adding a title element to the webpage. I also checked to ensure the HTML elements followed a logical structure and the header elements were in sequential order. I made no changes aside from  correcting HTML indentation as it seemed the structure and headers were all in order. I corrected a link that wasn't working, consolidated CSS, and added comments to both CSS and HTML.

A link to my project URL via GitHub is available [here](https://lexiehansen.github.io/horiseon_challenge/).

Here are screenshots of the completed webpage:
