# horiseon_challenge
Refactoring the existing code to meet accessibility standards. 

My changes include the following:
- Added semantic HTML elements, such as header, article, aside, footer, and section.
- Added alt attributes to each image and 
- Added title element to the webpage 
- Correct HTML indentation
- Consolidate duplicate CSS elements
- Added appropriate comments to both CSS and HTML

A link to my project URL via GitHub is available [here](https://lexiehansen.github.io/horiseon_challenge/).

Here are screenshots of the completed webpage. Note that there are two separate screenshots.
